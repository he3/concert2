# Concert 2

Generation 2 of the opinionated agentic development life-cycle.

## Project Overview

This is the Concert framework itself — an orchestration system for agentic software development workflows. It manages missions through a structured pipeline (vision → requirements → architecture → UX → tasks → execution).

## Git Conventions

- Base branch: `main`
- Commit format: conventional commits (`type: description`)
- Pre-v1: breaking changes don't require major version bumps

## Development

- Concert configuration lives in `concert.jsonc`
- Mission state is tracked in `docs/concert/state.json`
- Workflows are defined in `docs/concert/workflows/`
- Agent definitions are in `docs/concert/agents/`
- Skills are in `docs/concert/skills/`

<!-- CONCERT:START — DO NOT MODIFY THIS SECTION. It is managed by Concert and will be overwritten on `concert update`. -->

## Concert

This project uses [Concert](https://github.com/he3-org/concert) for agentic development orchestration.

### Commands

- `/concert:init` — Start a new mission
- `/concert:review` — Review a stage
- `/concert:accept` — Accept a stage
- `/concert:status` — Check current status
- `/concert:continue` — Continue to next stage or resume execution
- `/concert:debug` — Debug an issue
- `/concert:verify` — Verify work
- `/concert:quick` — Run a quick task
- `/concert:restart` — Restart a stage
- `/concert:replan` — Replan from a stage
- `/concert:archive` — Archive completed mission and reset state

### State

- Configuration: `concert.jsonc`
- State: `docs/concert/state.json`
- Agents: `docs/concert/agents/`
- Workflows: `docs/concert/workflows/`
- Skills: `docs/concert/skills/`
- Missions: `docs/concert/missions/`

### Do Not Modify

The following paths are managed by Concert and must not be modified by other agents, refactoring tools, or automated processes. They will be overwritten on `concert update`:

- `docs/concert/agents/`
- `docs/concert/workflows/`
- `docs/concert/skills/`
- `.claude/commands/concert/`
- `.github/agents/concert-*.agent.md`
- `concert.jsonc` (modify manually only — Concert preserves your changes on update)
