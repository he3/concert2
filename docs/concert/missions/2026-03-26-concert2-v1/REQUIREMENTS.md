# Requirements: Concert 2 v1

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Repository Bootstrapping via npx (must)

The system must provide a CLI command `npx @he3-org/concert init` that bootstraps a repository with all Concert files.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Running `npx @he3-org/concert init` in a git repository creates the `docs/concert/` directory structure with agents, workflows, skills, and configuration files
- Running `npx @he3-org/concert init` creates `.github/agents/` with all GitHub Agent definition files
- Running `npx @he3-org/concert init` creates `.github/workflows/` with Concert workflow files (auto-continue, version-check)
- Running `npx @he3-org/concert init` creates `concert.jsonc` at the project root with default configuration
- Running `npx @he3-org/concert init` creates `docs/concert/state.json` with empty/initial state
- If Concert files already exist, the command warns and asks for confirmation before overwriting managed files
- The command succeeds in a clean git repository with no prior Concert installation
- The command exits with a non-zero code and a descriptive error if run outside a git repository

### FR-002: Mission Initialization (must)

The system must support creating a new mission via an interactive interview process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-init` command starts an interactive interview session
- The interviewer agent reads existing project specs (`docs/concert/*-SPEC.md`) before asking questions
- The interviewer asks one question at a time and waits for a response before proceeding
- The interview covers: what, who, why, scope, constraints, success criteria, and existing context
- The interviewer proposes a feature size (small/medium/large) and asks the user to confirm
- The interviewer summarizes the vision back to the user and waits for confirmation before writing
- A mission folder is created at `docs/concert/missions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`
- A `VISION.md` file is written to the mission folder
- `state.json` is updated with mission name, path, workflow, branch, stage, and pipeline state
- The interviewer commits the new mission files
- The output ends with actionable next steps including file paths and commands
- The command fails with a clear message if run in a non-interactive environment (GitHub Agents UI)

### FR-003: One Active Mission Per Repo (must)

The system must enforce a single active mission per repository at any time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- If `state.json` already has an active mission and `concert-init` is run, the user is warned and must explicitly choose to start a new mission
- Only one mission's state is tracked in `state.json` at a time
- Previous mission data remains in its `docs/concert/missions/` folder but is not active

### FR-004: Pipeline Stage Execution — Requirements (must)

The system must support generating requirements from an accepted vision.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-plan` command auto-selects the requirements stage when vision is accepted and requirements are pending
- The `concert-analyst` agent reads VISION.md, existing project specs, and scans the codebase
- The agent produces `REQUIREMENTS.md` in the mission folder with: functional requirements (unique IDs, acceptance criteria, priorities), non-functional requirements, data requirements, integration requirements, edge cases, out-of-scope, assumptions, and open questions
- `state.json` is updated with `pipeline.requirements = "draft"`
- The output ends with actionable next steps

### FR-005: Pipeline Stage Execution — Architecture (must)

The system must support generating an architecture plan from accepted requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-plan` command auto-selects the architecture stage when requirements are accepted
- The `concert-architect` agent reads VISION.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, existing specs, and deeply analyzes the codebase
- The agent produces `ARCHITECTURE.md` with: system overview, tech stack decisions with rationale, component design, data model, API design, error handling, security, performance, integration points, trade-offs, and migration plan
- `state.json` is updated with `pipeline.architecture = "draft"`
- The output ends with actionable next steps

### FR-006: Pipeline Stage Execution — UX Design (must)

The system must support generating UX specifications from accepted architecture.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-plan` command auto-selects the UX stage when architecture is accepted
- The `concert-designer` agent reads all mission docs and loads platform-specific UX skills
- The agent produces `UX.md` with: user flows, information architecture, component specifications (with all states), interaction patterns, accessibility requirements, and platform conventions
- `state.json` is updated with `pipeline.ux = "draft"`
- The output ends with actionable next steps

### FR-007: Pipeline Stage Execution — Task Planning (must)

The system must support decomposing approved plans into executable phases and task files.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-plan` command auto-selects the tasks stage when UX is accepted
- The `concert-planner` agent reads all approved mission documents and analyzes the codebase
- The agent creates a `phases/` directory structure with numbered phase directories
- Each phase directory contains task files named `TASK-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-<model>.md`
- Each task file has YAML frontmatter with: task slug, title, depends_on, wave number, and model tier (haiku/sonnet/opus)
- Each task within a file specifies: files to create/modify, requirements, tests to write, skills to apply, and acceptance criteria
- The agent assigns the lowest viable model tier to each task
- Dependency ordering between task files is valid (no circular dependencies)
- `state.json` is updated with `pipeline.tasks = "planned"`, `phases_total`, and `tasks_total`
- The output ends with a summary of phases and task counts plus next steps

### FR-008: Pipeline Stage Execution — Code Execution (must)

The system must support executing task files through phases and waves with atomic commits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-run` command starts execution from the current phase/task position in `state.json`
- Tasks within a wave respect dependency ordering (wave 1 before wave 2, etc.)
- Each task produces exactly one commit with conventional commit format
- After each task commit, `state.json` is updated with: incremented `tasks_completed`, updated execution position, history entry, and telemetry record
- Tests are run after each task implementation; all tests must pass (not just new ones)
- Failed tests trigger up to 2 retries within the same context before stopping with a failure
- After all tasks in a phase complete, a regression gate runs the full test suite
- `PHASE-SUMMARY-NN.md` is written/updated after each task file and finalized at phase completion
- Execution stops immediately on failure with a failure block written to `state.json`

### FR-009: Review/Accept/Restart Cycle (must)

The system must support a review cycle at each planning stage (vision, requirements, architecture, UX, tasks).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- After each planning stage produces a draft, the user is prompted with: accept, review, or restart options
- `concert-review` reads `state.json` to determine the current stage and reviews the appropriate document
- `concert-review` presents findings organized by severity: critical, important, suggestion
- `concert-review` allows iterative refinement — the user can request changes, ask questions, or accept
- Changes are batched and written when the user says "done" or "update"
- `concert-accept` creates a project-level `*-SPEC.md` from the plan document (vision -> VISION-SPEC.md, requirements -> REQUIREMENTS-SPEC.md, etc.)
- `concert-accept` updates `state.json` with `pipeline.<stage> = "accepted"` and advances to the next stage
- `concert-restart` discards the current stage output and re-runs the consultant agent from scratch
- All three commands work with an explicit stage argument or default to the current stage from `state.json`
- The review agent is interactive-only and fails with a clear message in non-interactive environments

### FR-010: Cold-Start Recovery via concert-status (must)

The system must provide a `concert-status` command that fully recovers context from a blank session.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `concert-status` reads `state.json` and displays: mission name, branch, PR number, pipeline progress (visual), feature size, current position, execution progress (if applicable), cost estimates, blockers, recent history (last 3-5 entries), and next steps
- The command is read-only — it never modifies any files
- The command runs on a budget model (fast and cheap)
- The output includes both CLI and GitHub UI options in next steps
- The command works from any environment (interactive or non-interactive)
- If no active mission exists, it outputs "No active mission" with guidance to start one

### FR-011: Session Continuation (must)

The system must support resuming work after session crashes, timeouts, or user return.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-continue` command reads `state.json` and determines the exact continuation point
- It handles all possible states: mid-task, between tasks, between task files, between phases, pre-execution, post-execution, in planning stages, with failure blocks, with blockers
- If a failure block exists, it assesses whether to retry or suggest debugging
- It updates `state.json` continuously during execution for crash safety
- It writes `next_steps` for the next continuation session (assuming it may crash)
- The command works in both interactive and non-interactive environments

### FR-012: Managed File Headers (must)

All Concert-generated files must carry a "do not edit" header indicating they are managed by Concert.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Every agent definition file (`docs/concert/agents/*.md`) starts with a comment block: `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED BY CONCERT -- DO NOT EDIT ... -->`
- Every workflow file (`docs/concert/workflows/*.md`) starts with the same header
- Every skill file (`docs/concert/skills/*/SKILL.md`) starts with the same header
- Every GitHub agent file (`.github/agents/*.md`) starts with the same header
- Every GitHub workflow file (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) starts with a YAML comment header: `# AUTO-GENERATED BY CONCERT -- DO NOT EDIT`
- Mission files (VISION.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, etc.) do NOT carry managed headers — they are user content

### FR-013: Update Mechanism (must)

The system must support updating Concert files in a repository to a new version.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A command (e.g., `npx @he3-org/concert update` or an update agent) upgrades Concert files in an existing installation
- **Safe to overwrite:** Agent definitions, skill files, workflow files, GitHub agent files, and GitHub workflow files are replaced entirely from the new version
- **Surgical updates:** `concert-state.json` and `concert.jsonc` are merged intelligently — new fields are added, existing user values are preserved, removed fields are cleaned up
- **User content preserved:** Mission files (VISION.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, UX.md, TASK files, PHASE-SUMMARY files) are never modified or deleted
- The update process validates that state.json remains a valid schema after merging
- The update process reports what was changed

### FR-014: Command Naming Convention (must)

All Concert commands must be prefixed with `concert-` to avoid collisions with Claude Code and other tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Every user-facing command uses the `concert-` prefix: `concert-init`, `concert-plan`, `concert-run`, `concert-review`, `concert-accept`, `concert-restart`, `concert-status`, `concert-continue`, `concert-debug`, `concert-verify`, `concert-replan`
- No Concert command conflicts with built-in Claude Code commands
- GitHub Agent definition files in `.github/agents/` use the `concert-` prefix in their filenames

### FR-015: Actionable Next Steps on Every Output (must)

Every agent output must end with a structured "Next steps" section.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Every agent's final output includes a section titled "Next steps"
- Next steps include specific file paths (absolute where applicable)
- Next steps include copy-paste commands for both CLI and GitHub UI options
- Next steps include the most likely next action first
- Next steps are relevant to the current state (not generic)

### FR-016: One Question at a Time — Interview Agents (must)

Interactive interview agents must ask exactly one question at a time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-interviewer` agent asks a single question and waits for a response before formulating the next question
- Each answer may change the subsequent flow of questions
- The agent adapts questioning style to user communication style (brief responses get targeted follow-ups)
- The agent never presents a list of multiple questions at once

### FR-017: Model Tier Routing (must)

The system must route tasks to the appropriate model tier based on task file metadata.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Task files specify a `model` field in frontmatter with values `haiku`, `sonnet`, or `opus`
- In Claude Code sessions, subagents are spawned with the specified model tier
- The task filename includes the model suffix (e.g., `TASK-2026-03-22-db-schema-haiku.md`)
- Model tier assignment follows the guidelines: haiku for scaffolding/config/boilerplate, sonnet for business logic/APIs/tests, opus for security/complex algorithms/architecture

### FR-018: Code Quality Loop (should)

The system should support a coder-reviewer quality loop for complex task files.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Task files with more than 3 tasks use the full orchestrator-coder-reviewer pattern in Claude Code
- Task files with 3 or fewer tasks use simple single-runner mode
- The reviewer rates findings with severity levels: CRIT, MAJ, MIN, NTH, PASS
- Tasks with CRIT or MAJ findings are sent back to the coder for revision
- Maximum 3 revision cycles per task before escalating to human
- Simple mode is used when the environment does not support subagent spawning

### FR-019: Verification Stage (must)

The system must support acceptance testing against requirements after execution completes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-verify` command runs the QA agent
- The QA agent reads REQUIREMENTS-SPEC.md and all PHASE-SUMMARY files
- Each requirement is classified as PASS, PARTIAL, FAIL, or UNTESTABLE with evidence
- The agent produces `VERIFICATION.md` with pass/fail counts, per-requirement results, gap analysis, and remediation suggestions
- The agent produces `COST-REPORT.md` with model tier effectiveness, confidence accuracy, per-phase breakdown, and recommendations
- Failed/partial requirements generate suggested gap-closure task files

### FR-020: Retrospective / Self-Improvement (should)

The system should support post-mission retrospective analysis.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- After successful verification, if `self_improvement.enabled` is true in `concert.jsonc`, the retrospective agent runs
- The agent reads telemetry, failure_log, COST-REPORT.md, PHASE-SUMMARY files, and current agent/skill/workflow definitions
- The agent produces `CONCERT-IMPROVEMENT.md` with prioritized suggestions (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), each citing specific telemetry evidence
- The agent includes a "What Worked Well" section
- The retrospective agent never modifies Concert files — it only documents suggestions

### FR-021: Stage Override and Rollback (should)

The system should allow running stages out of order and rolling back to earlier stages.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `concert-plan <stage>` runs the specified stage regardless of current pipeline position
- `concert-review <stage>` reviews a specific stage's output
- `concert-accept <stage>` accepts a specific stage
- `concert-replan <stage>` marks all subsequent stages as "needs re-run", re-runs the specified consultant, and after acceptance, re-runs all downstream consultants
- Rollback does not delete committed code

### FR-022: Telemetry Logging (must)

The system must log structured telemetry after each task completion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- After each task commits successfully, a telemetry record is appended to `state.json` -> `telemetry[]`
- Each record includes: task_file, task_index, phase, model_assigned, confidence, review_result, revision_count, skills_loaded, files_changed, completed_at
- Confidence is assessed based on: test coverage, requirements clarity, pattern familiarity, complexity vs model tier, acceptance criteria satisfaction
- Only successful completions are logged in telemetry; failures go to `failure_log[]`

### FR-023: Failure Handling (must)

The system must handle failures with structured error classification and crash-safe state.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- On task failure, execution stops immediately — no skipping ahead
- A failure block is written to `state.json` with: phase, phase_name, task_file, task_index, task_title, failed_at (ISO 8601), error_type, error_summary, files_touched, last_successful_commit, context_usage_percent
- Error types include: test_failure, build_error, context_exhaustion, dependency_missing, model_capability_exceeded, timeout, unknown
- The failure is appended to `failure_log[]`
- The working tree is left dirty (no rollback)
- Recovery guidance is output with specific next steps

### FR-024: Debugging Agent (should)

The system should provide a scientific-method debugging agent.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-debug` command spawns the debugger agent
- The agent reads the failure block from `state.json` and relevant code/tests
- The agent forms 2-3 ranked hypotheses and tests each systematically
- Hypotheses and experiment results are persisted to `state.json` -> `debug_state` for crash recovery
- On fix: a regression test is added, the full test suite passes, and the failure block is cleared
- After 3 failed hypothesis cycles, the agent escalates to human

### FR-025: npm Package Distribution (must)

Concert 2 must be distributed as an npm package.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The package is published to npm under the name `@he3-org/concert`
- `npx @he3-org/concert init` bootstraps a repository without requiring a global install
- The package includes all agent definitions, workflow files, skill files, GitHub agent files, and GitHub workflow files as distributable assets
- The package has a `bin` entry in `package.json` for the `concert2` CLI command
- The package version follows semver (pre-v1, breaking changes do not require major bumps)

### FR-026: GitHub Agents UI Compatibility (must)

Concert commands must work from the GitHub Agents UI.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each Concert command has a corresponding `.github/agents/concert-<name>.md` file
- GitHub Agent files contain the agent description and point to the full agent definition in `docs/concert/agents/`
- Agents that require interactivity (`concert-init`, `concert-review`) detect non-interactive environments and output a clear error directing the user to Claude Code
- Non-interactive agents (`concert-plan`, `concert-run`, `concert-continue`, `concert-status`, `concert-verify`) work fully from GitHub Agents UI

### FR-027: Claude Code Web UI Compatibility (must)

Concert commands must work from the Claude Code web UI for interactive steps.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Interactive commands (`concert-init`, `concert-review`) function correctly in Claude Code web UI sessions
- The Claude Code skill commands (`/concert:init`, `/concert:plan`, etc.) map to the corresponding agent definitions
- All agent outputs render correctly as markdown in the Claude Code web UI

### FR-028: Git State Commitment (must)

All state changes must be committed to git.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- State changes are committed alongside the work that triggered them (e.g., a task commit includes the state.json update); state-only commits occur only when no other files changed (e.g., a stage transition)
- Every planning stage that produces a document commits the document
- Every task execution commits the code with conventional commit format
- State is always recoverable from the git history

### FR-029: Self-Dogfooding Capability (must)

Concert 2 must be usable to develop Concert 2 itself.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Concert 2 can be installed in its own repository
- A mission can be run through the full pipeline (vision through execution) on the Concert 2 codebase
- The Concert 2 agents, workflows, and skills work correctly when the target project IS Concert 2
- No circular dependency prevents Concert from analyzing/modifying its own files

### FR-030: Workflow Selection by Feature Size (must)

The system must select the appropriate workflow based on feature size.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Feature size "large" selects `CONCERT-WORKFLOW-MISSION-FULL.md` (vision, requirements, architecture, UX, tasks, execution)
- Feature size "medium" selects `CONCERT-WORKFLOW-MISSION-MEDIUM.md` (vision, requirements, architecture, tasks, execution)
- Feature size "small" selects `CONCERT-WORKFLOW-MISSION-SMALL.md` (vision, tasks, execution)
- The selected workflow determines which pipeline stages are active

### FR-031: Human Status Display (should)

The system should maintain a human-readable status display.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When `status_display` in `concert.jsonc` is `"wip_pr"`, the WIP PR body is updated with pipeline progress after each stage transition
- The status display shows the visual pipeline, current position, and recent history
- The display is updated after stage acceptance and phase completion

### FR-032: Auto-Continue Workflow (should)

The system should support automatic continuation with environment-aware execution strategy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A GitHub Actions workflow triggers on pushes to `docs/concert/state.json`
- The workflow checks if the mission stage is not "done" or "verified"
- If work remains, it triggers the appropriate continuation strategy based on environment
- **GitHub Actions environment:** supports parallel execution — can trigger multiple concurrent agents for independent tasks (e.g., wave tasks with no dependencies between them)
- **Claude Code web UI environment:** runs linearly — completes one task at a time, outputs `concert-continue` guidance for manual session continuation
- The decision logic for parallel vs. linear execution lives near the orchestration layer that assigns work, not in the auto-continue workflow itself
- The workflow files carry managed-file headers

### FR-033: Context Compaction (must)

The system must compact context as phases complete to keep agents within context window limits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agents reading execution state use a tiered strategy: current phase reads TASK files + PHASE-SUMMARY, previous phase reads PHASE-SUMMARY only, older phases are skipped unless specifically relevant
- PHASE-SUMMARY files contain enough information for downstream agents to understand completed work without reading individual TASK files
- The orchestrator monitors context usage and spawns continuation agents before hitting limits

### FR-034: Skills System (must)

The system must support a skills system that provides domain-specific guidance to agents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Skills are defined as markdown files in `docs/concert/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Each skill specifies file patterns indicating when it should apply (e.g., `**/*.ts`)
- Task files reference skills by name in their specification
- Agents load applicable skills before implementing or reviewing code
- `concert.jsonc` has a `skills` section with `auto_discover` and `enabled` fields

### FR-036: Interactive Mode Enforcement (must)

Interactive interview agents must be restricted to Claude Code unless the restriction is explicitly disabled.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `concert.jsonc` includes a configuration option `"interactive_mode": "claude_code_only"` (default)
- When set to `"claude_code_only"`, interactive agents (`concert-init`, `concert-review`) refuse to run in GitHub Agents UI and output a message directing the user to Claude Code
- When set to `"any"`, interactive agents attempt to run in any environment (for future GitHub interactivity support)
- The toggle is respected by all agents marked `interactive_only: true`
- The default value is `"claude_code_only"` in newly initialized repos

### FR-037: Quick Task Execution (must)

The system must provide a `concert-quick` command for small tasks that skip the full pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `concert-quick` command accepts a task description as an argument
- The agent operates as a senior full-stack developer with design, UX, security, and documentation expertise
- The agent uses all available tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, etc.)
- The agent follows TDD: writes tests first, then implements, then verifies all tests pass
- After implementation, the agent performs a thorough self-review covering: code quality, security implications, UX considerations, documentation completeness, and edge cases
- The agent produces a single conventional commit with the changes
- The agent updates `state.json` with a history entry for the quick task
- The agent does not create mission folders, VISION.md, or go through planning stages
- The agent runs on the highest model tier (opus) by default
- The output ends with actionable next steps
- The command works in both interactive and non-interactive environments

### FR-035: Cost-Optimized Task Decomposition (must)


The planner agent must prioritize decomposing tasks so they can be executed by the cheapest viable model tier.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The planner actively breaks down complex work into smaller, simpler tasks that haiku can handle before resorting to sonnet or opus
- Task decomposition favors many small haiku-tier tasks over fewer sonnet/opus-tier tasks when the result is equivalent
- The planner only assigns sonnet when the task genuinely requires business logic reasoning, nuanced test writing, or multi-file coordination that haiku cannot handle
- The planner only assigns opus when the task involves security-critical code, complex algorithms, or architectural decisions that sonnet cannot handle
- The planner documents the rationale for any task assigned above haiku tier (e.g., "sonnet: requires coordinating changes across 4 interdependent files")
- The resulting task plan is reviewed for tier inflation — if a task can be split further to use a cheaper tier, it should be

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Every task produces exactly one commit
- All commits use conventional commit format (`type(scope): description`)
- State updates are committed as part of the task commit (not separate commits)
- Planning stage outputs are committed with descriptive commit messages

### NFR-005: Agent Context Efficiency (should)

Agents should use context windows efficiently.

**Measurable Criteria:**

- Completed phases are summarized via PHASE-SUMMARY files instead of re-reading TASK files
- Skills are loaded only when relevant to the current task

### NFR-006: Idempotent Commands (should)

Concert commands should be safe to run multiple times.

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Running `concert-status` multiple times produces the same output (read-only)
- Running `concert-continue` when already at the correct position is a no-op
- Running `concert-accept` on an already-accepted stage produces a warning rather than an error

### NFR-007: Clear Error Messages (must)

All error states must produce clear, actionable error messages.

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Every error output includes: what failed, why it failed, and what the user should do next
- Interactive-only commands in non-interactive environments produce a specific message directing the user to Claude Code
- Missing prerequisites (e.g., no VISION.md when running requirements) produce specific guidance

- On accept, the plan document is copied/promoted to `docs/concert/` as `*-SPEC.md`:
  - VISION.md -> VISION-SPEC.md
  - REQUIREMENTS.md -> REQUIREMENTS-SPEC.md
  - ARCHITECTURE.md -> ARCHITECTURE-SPEC.md
  - UX.md -> UX-SPEC.md
- Spec files persist across missions and serve as cumulative project knowledge
- Spec files are read by subsequent mission agents for context

### DR-005: Telemetry Record Schema (must)

Each telemetry record must follow a defined schema.

**Schema Fields (per record):**
- `task_file`: string
- `task_index`: number (1-indexed)
- `phase`: number
- `model_assigned`: "haiku" | "sonnet" | "opus"
- `confidence`: "high" | "medium" | "low"
- `review_result`: "PASS" | "NTH" | "MIN" | "MAJ" | "CRIT" | "none"
- `revision_count`: number
- `skills_loaded`: string[]
- `files_changed`: number
- `completed_at`: string (ISO 8601)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Every successful task completion appends a record with all fields populated
- The schema is consistent across all executing agents

### DR-006: Task File Frontmatter Schema (must)

Task files must use a defined YAML frontmatter schema.

**Schema Fields:**
- `task`: string — slug identifier
- `title`: string — descriptive title
- `depends_on`: string[] — slugs of dependency tasks
- `wave`: number — wave assignment
- `model`: "haiku" | "sonnet" | "opus" — model tier

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All task files produced by the planner include valid frontmatter
- The runner agent parses frontmatter to determine model tier and dependencies
- The dependency DAG built from `depends_on` has no cycles

## Integration Requirements

### IR-001: GitHub Agents UI Integration (must)

Concert must integrate with the GitHub Agents UI for autonomous agent execution.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each Concert command has a `.github/agents/concert-<name>.md` file that GitHub Agents UI can discover
- Agent files include a `description` field that appears in the GitHub UI agent selector
- Agent files reference the full agent definition via "Read docs/concert/agents/..." instructions
- Non-interactive agents work fully when launched from GitHub Agents UI
- Interactive agents detect non-interactive mode and output a redirect message

### IR-002: Claude Code Skill Integration (must)

Concert must integrate with Claude Code's skill/command system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Concert commands are accessible via `/concert:init`, `/concert:plan`, `/concert:run`, `/concert:review`, `/concert:accept`, `/concert:status`, `/concert:continue`, `/concert:debug`, `/concert:verify`
- Skill commands load and execute the corresponding agent definitions
- The CLAUDE.md project configuration file references Concert commands

### IR-003: Git Integration (must)

Concert must integrate with git for all state management and code commits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All state changes, planning documents, and code are committed to git
- Branch naming follows the project's convention
- Commits use conventional commit format as configured in `concert.jsonc`
- The system works correctly with standard git operations (push, pull, merge)

### IR-004: npm Registry Integration (must)

Concert must be published to and installable from the npm registry.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The package is published to npm with proper metadata (name, version, description, license, repository)
- `npx @he3-org/concert init` works without prior installation
- `npx @he3-org/concert update` works for upgrading existing installations
- The package includes all necessary assets (agents, workflows, skills, templates)

### IR-005: GitHub Actions Integration (could)

Concert may integrate with GitHub Actions for automation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The auto-continue workflow triggers on state.json changes and signals when work remains
- The version-check workflow runs periodically to check for Concert updates
- Workflow files are generated during init and updated during update
- Workflow files carry managed-file headers

## Edge Cases

### EC-001: Init in a Repo with Existing Concert Files

**Expected Behavior:** Warn the user that Concert files already exist. Offer to update (overwrite managed files, preserve user content) or abort. Never silently overwrite.

### EC-002: Multiple Sessions Running Simultaneously

**Expected Behavior:** The second session reads `state.json` and detects that work is in progress. It either waits, reports the conflict, or proceeds from the latest committed state. Git's commit mechanism naturally serializes state updates.

### EC-003: Session Crash Mid-State-Write

**Expected Behavior:** Because state is committed after each task, a crash during the write-then-commit sequence loses at most one task. The next `concert-continue` reads the last committed `state.json` and resumes from there.

### EC-004: Circular Dependencies in Task Files

**Expected Behavior:** The planner agent detects circular dependencies during planning and reports an error before writing task files. If a cycle is somehow introduced manually, the runner detects it during wave resolution and stops with a `dependency_missing` error.

### EC-005: Context Window Exhaustion During Execution

**Expected Behavior:** The orchestrator monitors context usage. When approaching limits, it commits current progress, updates `state.json`, and spawns a continuation agent or outputs `concert-continue` guidance. At most one task of work is lost.

### EC-006: Model Tier Insufficient for Task

**Expected Behavior:** If a task assigned to haiku/sonnet fails due to complexity, it is flagged with `error_type: "model_capability_exceeded"`. The failure guidance suggests reassigning to a higher tier or decomposing the task.

### EC-007: Empty or Missing VISION.md When Running Requirements

**Expected Behavior:** The analyst agent detects the missing prerequisite and stops with a clear error: "VISION.md not found. Run `/concert:init` first." It does not generate requirements from thin air.

### EC-008: User Edits concert-state.json Manually

**Expected Behavior:** The system treats `state.json` as the source of truth regardless of how it was modified. If the manual edit creates an invalid state, the next agent to read it should report the schema violation clearly.

### EC-009: Running concert-accept When No Draft Exists

**Expected Behavior:** The command outputs an error: "No draft to accept for stage <stage>. Run `/concert:plan` first." It does not create an empty spec.

### EC-010: Test Suite Does Not Exist

**Expected Behavior:** If no test framework or test files are detected, the runner skips the test execution step but reports `confidence: "low"` and notes the absence of tests in telemetry. The regression gate is skipped with a warning.

### EC-011: Replan After Partial Execution

**Expected Behavior:** `concert-replan <stage>` marks downstream stages as needing re-run. The planner regenerates TASK files accounting for already-completed work by reading committed code and PHASE-SUMMARY files. Committed code is NOT rolled back.

### EC-012: Version Check Workflow Still References Go

**Expected Behavior:** The version-check GitHub Actions workflow (currently referencing `go install`) must be updated to use `npm`/`npx` for Concert 2. This is handled by the init/update process.

---

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly excluded from Concert 2 v1, as defined in the vision:

1. **Multi-runtime abstraction** — Cloudflare Workers, Deno, and other non-GitHub runtimes are future work. v1 targets GitHub Agents UI + Claude Code only.
2. **Agent self-improvement/learning loop** — Automated application of retrospective suggestions is deferred. v1 produces suggestions for human review only.
3. **Multi-mission concurrency** — Only one active mission per repository is supported. Running multiple missions simultaneously is out of scope.
4. **Custom web UI** — No web interface beyond GitHub's native UI and Claude Code's web UI. No Concert-specific dashboard or portal.
5. **Token counting / exact cost tracking** — v1 does not track token counts or exact dollar costs per task. Only rough mission-level estimates.
6. **Agent wall-clock timing** — Session crashes make timing unreliable; not tracked in v1.
7. **Full decision traces** — Verbose agent reasoning logs are too large for git-committed state.
8. **Multi-user / team features** — Concert is for a single developer. No collaboration, permissions, or team workflows.

---

## Assumptions

1. **GitHub is available and reliable.** The system assumes GitHub's platform (repos, Actions, Agents UI) is accessible during Concert operations.
2. **Claude Code web UI supports the Task tool.** Subagent spawning for the orchestrator-coder-reviewer loop requires this capability.
3. **npm registry is accessible for publishing and installing.** The distribution model depends on npm availability.
4. **Git is installed on the user's machine** for `npx @he3-org/concert init` bootstrapping.
5. **One developer operates Concert.** All design decisions assume a single user — no conflict resolution, locking, or multi-user state management is needed.
6. **Agent definitions are markdown files.** Both GitHub Agents UI and Claude Code consume markdown-based agent instructions.
7. **Conventional commits are the commit format.** All agents produce commits following the `type(scope): description` pattern.
8. **The user's browser can render GitHub markdown.** Status displays and mission documents are formatted in GitHub-Flavored Markdown.
9. **File system paths use forward slashes.** Concert targets Linux/macOS environments (Chromebook Linux terminal).
10. **The current Concert 1 agent/workflow/skill structure is the template for v1.** Concert 2 preserves the same logical structure while potentially changing the implementation.

## Open Questions

1. **Package name:** Resolved — using `@he3-org/concert` as the scoped npm package name.
2. **Version check workflow migration:** The current version-check workflow references Go (`go install`). Should it be updated in-place during v1 development, or left as-is until the update mechanism is built?
3. **GitHub Actions auto-continue:** The current auto-continue workflow only checks and signals — it does not actually launch agents. Should v1 implement the actual agent launching, or is the signal sufficient?
4. **Skill auto-discovery mechanism:** The `auto_discover` field in `concert.jsonc` is defined but the discovery mechanism is not specified. How should skills be auto-discovered — by file pattern matching against the codebase?
5. **State file naming:** Resolved — use `state.json` at `docs/concert/state.json`. The `concert-*` prefix is reserved for root-level files; files inside `docs/concert/` are already namespaced by directory.
